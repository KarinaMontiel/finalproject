      <h1 id="title3"><center> FAQs For High School and College</center> </h1>
      <!-- intro to the page -->

          <center>
            <p class="answers">
            Welcome to the FAQs page! The purpose of this page is to inform students in High School and
            College about what to expect, obscure opportuinities, and how to enjoy the new chapter of your life that's about to begin.
            Some of these questions were answered by Nicole Martindale a rising Sophomore at UCSD and Marivi Sifuentes a rising Junior at the University of Michigan.
            Also both of these students are Computer Science majors.
            </p>
          </center>


<!-- start of the Q and A -->
        <h3>What are some fun things to do in high school?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            Totally participate in school activities and have school spirit. I promise you won't regret it. Go to football games, basketball games, swim meets, whatever you can to help root for your team. Also, go to dances such as homecoming and prom or other activities your school hosts. The memories will be priceless. And lastly, get out of your comfort zone and try out for a sport. You will most likely find your passion and create longlasting friendships.</p>
        <h3>What AP classes should I take?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            It depends on what is offered at your school. At my school they do not offer AP's to freshman, so sophomore year I would reccomend starting with one such as AP World History. Do not take more than you can handle. For instance, my friend his junior year took four out of six AP classes and he was totally stressed. Now if this is something you can handle, go ahead and challenege yourself. Junior year I would reccomend taking any of the following: AP US History, AP Lang, AP Physics, AP Bio, AP Chemistry, AP Spanish, AP Statistics, AP Art, etc. Also, if you recieve free or reduced lunch, you are eligible for a fee waive; talk to your counselor for more information.</p>
        <h3>When should I take the SAT?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            Definitely take the PSAT your sophmore year and again your junior year. It will give you a look at how far ahead or behind you are. I would reccomend taking your first SAT in the winter of your junior year and again in the spring. This is so if you aren't comfortable with your score still, you can take it the beginning of your senior year. For practive tips, there are plenty of websites and books you can use for test prep. I have learned that the testprep books teach you how to understand the wording of the question, not how to do it neccessarily.</p>
        <h3>How can I get ahead in my class?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            Not a lot of people know, but you can most definitely take class at your local community college. Not only will you get high school credit, but you'll recieve college credit. This is a great way to get ahead in high school while also getting ahead in college. I would also join college prep programs such as AVID. These types of programs are known for getting students ahead.</p>
        <h3>What is some advice you have for junior year?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            <strong>Aubri Bowman:</strong>
              I wish someone would have told me this before I started my junior year: <strong>IT IS NOT AS BAD AS EVERYONE SAYS IT IS.</strong> I personally enjoyed my junior year but it was quite a step up from sophmore year. Sophmore year, teachers are little more relaxed than they are junior year. Probably because you're still a recovering freshman whereas when you're a junior they always say <strong>"You need to mature, you're going to be a senior next year."</strong> To make sure you don't stress yourself out, continue doing things that make you <strong>laugh, smile, and just have fun</strong>. I played two sports and I attened homecoming and prom. I also went to sports games, especially since rival games are the best. Lastly, <strong>DO NOT PROCRASTINATE!</strong> I am warning you. DO NOT DO IT! You may be able to get the assignment done but teachers know when you waited the last minute and your work isn't as good as it could have been. Even after you finally finish a six page essay in three hours, you'll be exhausted. If you don't procrastinate often, you will succeed. Do not be afraid to challenge yourself and it is okay to fail. Just learn from your mistakes, and push yourself to do better the next time.</p>
        <h3> What is UCSD college campus like?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            UCSD has 6 colleges: Warren College, Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC), Revelle,
             Marshall, Muir and Sixth College. If you’re applying to UCSD make sure you
             research which one you want to prioritize in your application.
             Don’t do random like I did!! Each college has its’ own general education
             requirements and houses in different locations on campus. I’m in ERC so my
             gen-ed requirements include a language requirement and lots of history classes.
            Warren College is more engineering/CS focused and a lot of their gen-ed
             requirements overlap with major requirements.
          </p>
        <h3>Do AP courses/tests matter? </h3>
          <p class="answers">
            AP courses count towards your high school GPA but an A is technically
            like a 5 towards your GPA (weighted) if your school is on a 4.0 scale.
            However, colleges do not look at AP test scores when admitting you.
            Once you’re admitted then they look at your scores to pass you out of
            classes and give you credits. Not all AP courses will be accepted for
            credit so look through the university websites or email an advisor to
            see which courses will transfer for credit.
            <a href="https://local-resources.ucdavis.edu/local_resources/docs/APIBCharts/APCurrent.pdf">Here</a> is an example chart
            for UC Davis but this may change so do a Google Search too

          </p>
        <h3> What is work study? </h3>
          <p class="answers">
            UCSD describes work study as
            <strong> “Work-study is subsidized employment for eligible undergraduates. </strong>
            You earn this self-help financial aid, so you
            don't have to repay it. The state or federal government, your hiring
            department, and the work-study program share the cost of your earnings.
            Work-study reduces your need for student loans, leaves you with less
            debt, and lets you explore careers while you gain work experience.”
            You have to apply for FAFSA (govt financial aid) to be considered for
            work study and then check for work-study awards in your award letter.
            If you accept the work-study award
            <strong>you have to get a job or you won’t get the moneys$$$</strong>

          </p>
        <h3>Are most of your classes taught by professors or TA’s? </h3>
          <p class="answers">
            <strong>Marivi Sifuentes:</strong>
               Courses that don’t have a discussion (like Calculus or English) are usually taught by professors or Graduate Student Instructors (GSI).
            Lectures are always led by professors but if a lecture has a lab or a discussion that is usually led by GSI. In some cases I have had TAs
            (undergrads) lead but usually these sections aren’t as helpful because of their lack of experience. I would suggest that you use Rate My Professor
            to figure out which lecturer or professor to choose.
          </p>
          <p class="answers">
            <strong> Nicole Martindale:</strong>
            All of my classes have lectures and discussions. So lectures are either Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday and discussions
            for each of these classes are once a week. Lectures are taught by professors/lecturers and discussions are led by TA’s/tutors who are usually graduate students.
          </p>
        <h3>How big are your classes? </h3>
          <p class="answers">
            <strong>Marvi Sifuentes:</strong>
            Sometimes I’m in auditorium with 400+ people, other
            times I’m in a lecture hall with space for 70, and sometimes I’m in a
            classroom with 15-30 people. It can sometimes depend on what class you’re
            taking, introductory courses in any subject are usually in the hundreds
            but upper-level courses tend to be smaller.
          </p>
          <p class='answers'>
            <strong>Nicole Martindale:</strong>
            All of my lectures are minimum 100 students.
            On average, lectures are usually 300-400 students which seems really
            big and scary but professors have microphones and usually slides or
            are demonstrating something on a big projector screen. Also that’s why
            discussions are so useful because they’re about 15-20 people each.
            When you’re enrolling in a class they all have the same lecture time
            and different discussion times, that’s why discussions are so small.
            In discussions, the TA usually reviews what was brought up in lecture
            that week and answers any questions.
          </p>
        <h3>Is it popular to study abroad?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            <strong>Marivi Sifuentes: </strong>
            Very! There are companies that provide opportunities but I
            would recommend that you speak with an advisor before signing up
            just so you can be completely sure that the courses will transfer to
            your university. Try finding/applying for study abroad scholarships
             offered by your university because it can be very expensive.
           </p>
           <p class="answers">
            <strong>Nicole Martindale:</strong>
             Probably. I’m not sure since I haven’t thought about it yet but
             there’s a lot of resources on campus for scholarships and information.
            <a href="https://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/">Here</a> is a resource for UCSD's program.

          <!-- <h3> In what ways is Studying Abroad beneficial?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            <strong> By studying abroad students will have the opportunity to
              travel the world and see what its like in foreign nations. Studying
              Abroad means studying in a new country, with that being said it comes with
              new interests and acivities that you may not have discovered if you were back
              at home which can be beneficial.

          <h3>How do I manage my life during Junior and Senior Year/Develope good habits?</h3>
            <p class="answers">
              <strong>Karina: </strong>
            1. First we can focus on time management for your classes. The most important thing is to
            download your school apps (ex:Classroom, Powerschool,Gmail) and make sure the Notifications are on.
            Antoher good habit is using the reminder or calendar app on your phone to set reminders for tests and
            due assignments so that you can always know what you have going on just by opening the app.
            Moreover, <strong>always</strong> budget time for your long term assignments to avoid stress.
            Although procrastination may be when your best work comes out, it's not fun when you have 3 essays
            and 2 presentations due the same week that you haven't started until that Sunday.

            2.Meanwhile balancing school you also have to manage your family. Being honest this is
            very hard question because every family is unique but I'll give you some personal tips
             that help me with my family. First, you have to be as honest as possible with your family so
             they know what pressures you are handling and they might be able to help. Second, spend time with them
             so you can get a break from studying and just be surrounded by unconditional love and
             people who only want you to succeed.

             3.Moreover to prep for SAT/ACT and just more advanced classes in general it is
              all about knowing what you can handle to not spread yourself too thin. Definitely
              make friends and form study groups for your classes, especially the AP's because
              you want to get help from people in the same situation as you and you can suffer together.
              Another helpful way to study is grabbing prep books from the library or your counselor's office.
              Finally, start off studying in chunks by eparating what you know and what you need to focus and practice more.
              Don't over study!!! Yes this is a thing, just understand that the night before the test you know
               all you can know by that point so just accept it and sleep. The days of any big test just dress
               comfortable so you can focus but not to the point where you want to sleep.

             </p>

             <h3>Do colleges allow students to switch majors?</h3>
               <p class="answers">
                 <strong>Khai'Aira:</strong>
                 Colleges in fact do allow students to switch their majors.
                 Studies find that students switch their majors at least once,if not multiple times.
                 With that being said it is best to choose a college that offer multiple majors that interest you.
               </p>

               <h3>What are the GED requirements when it comes to applying to college?</h3>
                 <p class="answers">
                   <strong>Khai'Aira:</strong>
                   All community colleges and almost all four year colleges accept those who have a GED Although,
                   a high school diploma is a better credential than a GED.If you don't have a GED and want to apply
                   to a community college you might have to take a placement test just so they can see what classes
                   are best for you to take.
                 </p>

                 <h3>How do you save more money?</h3>
                   <p class="answers">
                     <strong>Khai'Aira:</strong>
                     Saving money can be hard. In order to save money build yourself an emergency fund.
                     This should be money you save just in case your running low plus,its always good
                     to have some money put up to the side because you never know what could happen.
                     It would also help if you create a budget for yourself and try your hardest not to go over that budget.
                     You can limit spending money by deciding whether or not you NEED or WANT whatever it is you are trying to purchase.
                     If you do these three things you should see yourself saving more money rather than spending it.

                   <h3>Do grades matter in college?</h3>
                     <p class="answers">
                       <strong>Karina:</strong>
                      Grades are definitely important in college so that you can actually graduate.
                      Moreover, grades do affect some of the jobs you can apply for during and
                      even after college. Generally, if you maintain a 3.0 GPA or higher you shouldn't
                      worry. Although the 3.0 GPA is good if you are looking to stand out as an applicant
                      at a new job that may be competitive you should aim higher with your grades, and
                      be able to apply anywhere without feeling self conscious about sending in your transcript.
