            Welcome to the FAQs page! The purpose of this page is to inform students in High School and
            College about what to expect, obscure opportuinities, and how to enjoy the new chapter of your life that's about to begin.
            Some of these questions were answered by Nicole Martindale a rising Sophomore at UCSD and Marivi Sifuentes a rising Junior at the University of Michigan.
            Also both of these students are Computer Science majors.

<!-- start of the Q and A -->
        <h3> What is UCSD college campus like?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            UCSD has 6 colleges: Warren College, Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC), Revelle,
             Marshall, Muir and Sixth College. If you’re applying to UCSD make sure you
             research which one you want to prioritize in your application.
             Don’t do random like I did!! Each college has its’ own general education
             requirements and houses in different locations on campus. I’m in ERC so my
             gen-ed requirements include a language requirement and lots of history classes.
            Warren College is more engineering/CS focused and a lot of their gen-ed
             requirements overlap with major requirements.
          </p>
        <h3>Do AP courses/tests matter? </h3>
          <p class="answers">
            AP courses count towards your high school GPA but an A is technically
            like a 5 towards your GPA (weighted) if your school is on a 4.0 scale.
            However, colleges do not look at AP test scores when admitting you.
            Once you’re admitted then they look at your scores to pass you out of
            classes and give you credits. Not all AP courses will be accepted for
            credit so look through the university websites or email an advisor to
            see which courses will transfer for credit.
            <a href="https://local-resources.ucdavis.edu/local_resources/docs/APIBCharts/APCurrent.pdf">Here</a> is an example chart
            for UC Davis but this may change so do a Google Search too

        <h3> What is work study? </h3>
          <p class="answers">
            UCSD describes work study as
            <strong> “Work-study is subsidized employment for eligible undergraduates. </strong>
            You earn this self-help financial aid, so you
            don't have to repay it. The state or federal government, your hiring
            department, and the work-study program share the cost of your earnings.
            Work-study reduces your need for student loans, leaves you with less
            debt, and lets you explore careers while you gain work experience.”
            You have to apply for FAFSA (govt financial aid) to be considered for
            work study and then check for work-study awards in your award letter.
            If you accept the work-study award
            <strong>you have to get a job or you won’t get the moneys$$$</strong>

          </p>
        <h3>Are most of your classes taught by professors or TA’s? </h3>
          <p class="answers">
            Marivi Sifuentes: Courses that don’t have a discussion (like Calculus or English) are usually taught by professors or Graduate Student Instructors (GSI).
            Lectures are always led by professors but if a lecture has a lab or a discussion that is usually led by GSI. In some cases I have had TAs
            (undergrads) lead but usually these sections aren’t as helpful because of their lack of experience. I would suggest that you use Rate My Professor
            to figure out which lecturer or professor to choose.
          </p>
          <p class="answers">
            Nicole Martindale: All of my classes have lectures and discussions. So lectures are either Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday and discussions
            for each of these classes are once a week. Lectures are taught by professors/lecturers and discussions are led by TA’s/tutors who are usually graduate students.
          </p>
        <h3>How big are your classes? </h3>
          <p class="answers">
            Marvi Sifuentes: Sometimes I’m in auditorium with 400+ people, other
            times I’m in a lecture hall with space for 70, and sometimes I’m in a
            classroom with 15-30 people. It can sometimes depend on what class you’re
            taking, introductory courses in any subject are usually in the hundreds
            but upper-level courses tend to be smaller.
          </p>
          <p class='answers'>
            Nicole Martindale: All of my lectures are minimum 100 students.
            On average, lectures are usually 300-400 students which seems really
            big and scary but professors have microphones and usually slides or
            are demonstrating something on a big projector screen. Also that’s why
            discussions are so useful because they’re about 15-20 people each.
            When you’re enrolling in a class they all have the same lecture time
            and different discussion times, that’s why discussions are so small.
            In discussions, the TA usually reviews what was brought up in lecture
            that week and answers any questions.
          </p>
        <h3>Is it popular to study abroad?</h3>
          <p class="answers">
            Marivi Sifuentes: Very! There are companies that provide opportunities but I
            would recommend that you speak with an advisor before signing up
            just so you can be completely sure that the courses will transfer to
            your university. Try finding/applying for study abroad scholarships
             offered by your university because it can be very expensive.
           </p>
           <p class="answers">
            Nicole Martindale: Probably. I’m not sure since I haven’t thought about it yet but
             there’s a lot of resources on campus for scholarships and information.
