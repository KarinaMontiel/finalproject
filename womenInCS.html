    <p>Computer science is a field of study that takes determination, willpower, confidence, trial and error. All of these characteristics will either be adopted by you or be strengthened. Women are the past, present, and future, which we all have known, but we can't let our assumptions keep us from becoming something great. For example, I had to be introduced to this great field of study we call computer science by my dad. Without his reccommendation, I would have never found my new found passion.</p>
    <p> Below I have created some graphs that demonstrate the gender gap on women in tech and shows the demographics of these companies.</p>

    <p>Computer science is a way for people to express themselves while also being able to critcally think about the informtion given to them first hand. Many students have asked the question, "What should I major in?". There isn't just one defintion of computer science, so I will describe multiple of the general majors.</p>
