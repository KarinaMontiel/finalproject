    <p>Computer science is a field of study that takes determination, willpower, confidence, trial and error. All of these characteristics will either be adopted by you or be stengthened. Women are the past, present, and future, which we all have known, but we can't let our assumptions keep us from becoming something great. For example, I had to be introduced to this great field of study we call computer science by my dad. Without his reccommendation I would have never found my new fond passion.</p>
