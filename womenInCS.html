        <p>Computer science is a field of study that not many girls are introduced to at a young age. This could be a reason why there is such a large gender gap in this industry. It has also been proven that many girls find an interest in the field, but they dont follow through with it leaving a huge dent in the diversity amongst men in women in the workplace. This page has been created to help push students to further their passion for CS or just introduce them to the idea and provide them with resources to look further into this new found idea.</p>

        <p> Below some graphs have been created to demonstrate the gender gap on women in tech and shows the demographics of these companies.</p>

      <p>Computer science is a way for people to express themselves while also being able to critcally think about the informtion given to them first hand. Many students have asked the question, "What should I major in?". There isn't just one defintion of computer science, so I will describe multiple of the general majors.</p><br>
